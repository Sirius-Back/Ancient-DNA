# Ancient-DNA
My experience in aDNA analysis: scripts and notes. 

# My Journey into Ancient DNA Research
My exploration of ancient DNA (aDNA) began in 2021 at Sirius University (Sochi, Russia), where I immersed myself in the interdisciplinary world of paleogenomics. This field—where biology, archaeology, and computational science converge—fascinated me from the start, and I dedicated myself to mastering both its wet-lab and bioinformatics challenges.

# Wet-Lab Expertise
I gained hands-on experience with core aDNA techniques, including:

1) DNA/RNA extraction from degraded samples (e.g., bones, teeth).

2) NGS library preparation for Illumina sequencing, optimizing protocols for low-input DNA.

3) Ancient sample handling, such as bone drilling and contamination prevention.

4) Gel electrophoresis and other QC methods to assess DNA preservation.

# Bioinformatics & Population Genomics
To analyze the data I generated, I developed skills in:

 - NGS data processing: Quality control (FastQC/MultiQC), adapter trimming, and read alignment (BWA, Bowtie2).

 - Variant calling (GATK, samtools) and contamination assessment (e.g., ANGSD).

 - Population genetics tools: PCA (PLINK/EIGENSOFT), ADMIXTURE, f-statistics (ADMIXTOOLS), and kinship analysis.

 - aDNA-specific challenges: Damage pattern analysis (mapDamage), reference bias mitigation, and sex determination (X/Y read ratios).

# Resources & Scripts
This repository houses:

 - Custom scripts for processing aDNA data (QC, alignment, and analysis).

 - Notes and protocols summarizing best practices for wet-lab and computational work.

 - Curated references (papers, tutorials, and toolkits) that guided my learning in this rapidly evolving field.

# Why This Matters
Ancient DNA unlocks stories about human migration, adaptation, and disease history—but it demands rigor at every step, from extraction to interpretation. Here, I document my progress, share reusable code, and hope to collaborate with others passionate about uncovering the past.
